                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to Lesson 2 of CP363: Database I. In this lesson, we will explore Entity-Relationship
                        (ER) modeling, a fundamental technique for conceptual database design. ER modeling provides a
                        way to visualize the structure of a database before implementing it, helping to ensure that the
                        database accurately represents the real-world system it's modeling.</p>

                    <p>Database design is a critical phase in database development. A well-designed database is easier
                        to implement, maintain, and modify as requirements change. It also provides better performance
                        and data integrity. Entity-Relationship modeling is the first step in this design process,
                        allowing us to create a high-level conceptual model of the data and relationships that will be
                        stored in the database.</p>

                    <p>The ER model was first proposed by Peter Chen in 1976 and has since become one of the most widely
                        used approaches for conceptual database design. It provides a set of concepts and notations that
                        allow database designers to capture the semantics of real-world data in a graphical
                        representation called an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).</p>

                    <p>In this lesson, we will learn about the database design process, the core concepts of the ER
                        model (entities, attributes, relationships), different notations for ER diagrams, and practical
                        techniques for creating effective ER models. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to
                        create ER diagrams for various scenarios and understand how these diagrams serve as a blueprint
                        for database implementation.</p>

                    <p>Let's begin our exploration of Entity-Relationship modeling!</p>
                </div>

                <div id="database-design-process">
                    <h3>Part 1: Database Design Process</h3>

                    <p>Before diving into the specifics of ER modeling, it's important to understand where it fits
                        within the overall database design process. Database design typically follows a structured
                        approach consisting of several phases:</p>

                    <div id="requirements-collection">
                        <h4>Requirements Collection and Analysis</h4>

                        <p>The database design process begins with understanding what the database needs to accomplish.
                            This involves:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Interviewing stakeholders</strong>: Meeting with users, managers, and other
                                stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analyzing existing systems</strong>: Examining current data storage methods,
                                forms, reports, and processes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Documenting requirements</strong>: Creating detailed documentation of data
                                requirements, including what data needs to be stored, how it will be used, and any
                                constraints or business rules.</li>
                            <li><strong>Defining scope</strong>: Determining the boundaries of the database system—what
                                it will and won't include.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The output of this phase is a set of requirements specifications that serve as the foundation
                            for the subsequent design phases.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="conceptual-design">
                        <h4>Conceptual Database Design</h4>

                        <p>This is where Entity-Relationship modeling comes into play. The conceptual design phase
                            involves:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Identifying entities</strong>: Determining the main objects or concepts about
                                which data will be stored.</li>
                            <li><strong>Defining attributes</strong>: Specifying the properties or characteristics of
                                each entity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Establishing relationships</strong>: Determining how entities are related to
                                each other.</li>
                            <li><strong>Creating ER diagrams</strong>: Representing the conceptual model graphically
                                using ER notation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The conceptual design is independent of any specific database management system (DBMS) or
                            implementation details. It focuses on capturing the semantics of the real-world system being
                            modeled.</p>

                        <p>The primary output of this phase is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that represents the
                            conceptual schema of the database.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="logical-design">
                        <h4>Logical Database Design</h4>

                        <p>Once the conceptual design is complete, it is translated into a logical model that can be
                            implemented in a specific type of database system. For relational databases, this involves:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mapping entities to tables</strong>: Converting each entity into a table
                                (relation).</li>
                            <li><strong>Mapping attributes to columns</strong>: Converting each attribute into a column
                                in the appropriate table.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mapping relationships</strong>: Implementing relationships through foreign keys
                                or relationship tables.</li>
                            <li><strong>Normalization</strong>: Applying normalization techniques to eliminate
                                redundancy and ensure data integrity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Defining constraints</strong>: Specifying primary keys, foreign keys, unique
                                constraints, and other integrity constraints.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The logical design is specific to a type of database model (e.g., relational, document,
                            graph) but is still independent of any specific DBMS product.</p>

                        <p>The output of this phase is a logical schema, typically represented as a set of table
                            definitions with columns, data types, and constraints.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="physical-design">
                        <h4>Physical Database Design</h4>

                        <p>The final phase of database design involves optimizing the logical design for a specific DBMS
                            and hardware environment. This includes:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Selecting storage structures</strong>: Determining how data will be physically
                                stored.</li>
                            <li><strong>Creating indexes</strong>: Defining indexes to improve query performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Implementing security</strong>: Setting up user accounts, roles, and
                                permissions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tuning for performance</strong>: Optimizing the database for specific workloads
                                and hardware configurations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Planning for growth</strong>: Considering future data volume and usage patterns.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The physical design is specific to a particular DBMS product (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, SQL
                            Server) and hardware environment.</p>

                        <p>The output of this phase is a physical schema that can be implemented directly in the target
                            DBMS, including SQL statements for creating tables, indexes, views, and other database
                            objects.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>In this lesson, we will focus primarily on the conceptual design phase, specifically on
                        Entity-Relationship modeling. The ER model we create will serve as the foundation for the
                        logical and physical design phases that follow.</p>

                        <p><strong>Entity</strong>: An entity is a real-world object, concept, or event about which we
                            want to store data. Examples include a person, a place, a product, an order, or an event.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Entity Set</strong>: An entity set is a collection of entities of the same type. For
                            example, all students in a university form the "Student" entity set, and all courses form
                            the "Course" entity set.</p>

                        <p>In ER diagrams, entity sets are typically represented as rectangles labeled with the name of
                            the entity set.</p>

                        <p><strong>Types of Entities</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Strong Entity</strong>: An entity that can exist independently of other
                                entities. It has its own primary key that uniquely identifies each entity instance.
                                Examples include Student, Employee, and Department.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weak Entity</strong>: An entity that cannot exist independently and relies on
                                another entity (its owner or identifying entity) for its identification. A weak entity
                                does not have a complete primary key of its own. Examples include Dependent (of an
                                Employee) or Room (in a Building).</li>

                        <h3>Attributes and Their Types</h3>

                        <p><strong>Attribute</strong>: An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity. For
                            example, a Student entity might have attributes such as student_id, name, date_of_birth, and
                            email.</p>

                        <p>In ER diagrams, attributes are typically represented as ovals connected to their entity
                            rectangle.</p>

                        <p><strong>Types of Attributes</strong>:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Simple Attribute</strong>: An attribute that cannot be divided further. Examples
                                include age, gender, or salary.</li>
                            <li><strong>Composite Attribute</strong>: An attribute that can be divided into smaller
                                subparts. For example, address can be divided into street, city, state, and zip code.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Single-valued Attribute</strong>: An attribute that holds only one value for
                                each entity instance. Examples include social security number or date of birth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-valued Attribute</strong>: An attribute that can hold multiple values for
                                each entity instance. Examples include phone numbers (a person may have multiple phone
                                numbers) or skills (an employee may have multiple skills).</li>
                            <li><strong>Derived Attribute</strong>: An attribute whose value can be calculated from
                                other attributes. Examples include age (derived from date of birth and current date) or
                                total_price (derived from quantity and unit_price).</li>
                            <li><strong>Stored Attribute</strong>: An attribute whose value is explicitly stored in the
                                database, as opposed to being derived.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complex Attribute</strong>: An attribute that combines multiple types, such as a
                                multi-valued composite attribute.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In ER diagrams, different types of attributes are represented with different notations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simple attributes: Regular ovals</li>

                        <h3>Keys</h3>

                        <p>Keys are special attributes or combinations of attributes that uniquely identify entity
                            instances:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Candidate Key</strong>: An attribute (or combination of attributes) that can
                                uniquely identify each entity instance in an entity set. An entity set may have multiple
                                candidate keys.</li>
                            <li><strong>Primary Key</strong>: The candidate key chosen to be the main identifier for an
                                entity set. In ER diagrams, primary key attributes are often underlined.</li>
                            <li><strong>Composite Key</strong>: A key that consists of multiple attributes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partial Key</strong>: An attribute (or combination of attributes) that can
                                uniquely identify weak entity instances that are related to the same owner entity. A
                                partial key combined with the primary key of the owner entity forms the primary key of
                                the weak entity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>For example, in a Student entity set, student_id might be the primary key, while email could
                            be another candidate key (assuming each student has a unique email address).</p>

                        <h3>Relationships and Relationship Sets</h3>

                        <p><strong>Relationship</strong>: A relationship is an association between two or more entities.
                            For example, a Student "enrolls in" a Course, or an Employee "works in" a Department.</p>

                        <p><strong>Relationship Set</strong>: A relationship set is a collection of relationships of the
                            same type. For example, all enrollment relationships between students and courses form the
                            "Enrolls_In" relationship set.</p>

                        <p>In ER diagrams, relationship sets are typically represented as diamonds labeled with the name
                            of the relationship.</p>

                        <p><strong>Degree of a Relationship</strong>:</p>

                        <p>Constraints specify rules that the data in the database must satisfy. Two important types of
                            constraints in ER modeling are cardinality and participation constraints:</p>

                        <p><strong>Cardinality Constraints</strong>: Cardinality specifies the number of entities to
                            which another entity can be related via a relationship set. Common cardinality ratios
                            include:</p>

                        <p><strong>Participation Constraints</strong>: Participation constraints specify whether all
                            entities in an entity set must participate in a relationship set. There are two types:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Total Participation (Mandatory)</strong>: Every entity in the entity set must
                                participate in at least one relationship in the relationship set. In ER diagrams, this
                                is often represented by a double line connecting the entity set to the relationship. For
                                example, every Employee must work in a Department.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partial Participation (Optional)</strong>: Some entities in the entity set may

                                represented by a single line. For example, Not every employee manages a department. Employee participation in manages relationship is partial
                                </li>

                        <p><strong>Characteristics of Weak Entities</strong>:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A weak entity does not have a complete primary key of its own.</li>
                            <li>It depends on a strong entity (owner) for its existence.</li>
                            <li>It has a partial key that can uniquely identify weak entity instances related to the
                                same owner entity.</li>
                            <li>The primary key of a weak entity is the combination of the primary key of its owner
                                entity and its own partial key.</li>
                            <li>A weak entity has total participation in its identifying relationship with the owner
                                entity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Identifying Relationship</strong>: The relationship between a weak entity and its
                            owner entity is called an identifying relationship. In ER diagrams, weak entities are often
                            represented as double-bordered rectangles, and identifying relationships as double-bordered
                            diamonds.</p>

                        <p><strong>Example</strong>: Consider a company database where each Employee can have multiple
                            Dependents (e.g., spouse, children). The Dependent entity is a weak entity because:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A Dependent cannot exist in the database without being associated with an Employee.</li>
                            <li>The name of a Dependent alone is not enough to uniquely identify them (multiple
                                employees might have dependents with the same name).</li>
                            <li>The primary key of Dependent would be the combination of employee_id (from the Employee
                                entity) and dependent_name (the partial key of Dependent).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In this example, "Has_Dependent" would be the identifying relationship between Employee and
                            Dependent.</p>

                    <p>Entity-Relationship diagrams (ERDs) provide a visual representation of the ER model. Several
                        notations have been developed for drawing ERDs, each with its own symbols and conventions. Let's

                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Identifying Entities</strong>:</p>

                            <li>Determine if each potential entity has multiple instances and unique identifiers.</li>
                            <li>Examples: Customer, Product, Order, Employee, Department.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Look for properties or characteristics of the identified entities.</li>

                            <li>Identify which attributes can serve as keys.</li>
                            <li>Examples: For a Customer entity, attributes might include customer_id, name, address,
                                phone, and email.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Identifying Relationships</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Look for verbs or associations between entities in the requirements.</li>
                            <li>Determine how entities interact or are related to each other.</li>
                            <li>Identify the cardinality and participation constraints for each relationship.</li>
                            <li>Examples: Customer "places" Order, Employee "works in" Department, Student "enrolls in"
                                Course.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Example Process</strong>:</p>
                        <p>Consider the following requirement: "A university needs a database to track students,
                            courses, and enrollments. Each student has a unique ID, name, date of birth, and email. Each
                            course has a unique code, title, credit hours, and is offered by a department. Students can
                            enroll in multiple courses, and each enrollment has a semester and a grade."</p>

                        <p>From this requirement, we can identify:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Entities: Student, Course, Department</li>

                                    <li>Course: course_code (key), title, credit_hours</li>

                            <li>Relationships:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Student "enrolls in" Course (M:N relationship with attributes semester and
                                        grade)</li>
                                    <li>Department "offers" Course (1:N relationship)</li>

                        <h3>Common Design Patterns</h3>

                        <p>Certain patterns appear frequently in ER modeling. Recognizing these patterns can help
                            streamline the design process:</p>

                        <p><strong>Master-Detail Pattern</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A one-to-many relationship between a "master" entity and multiple "detail" entities.
                            </li>
                            <li>Example: Order (master) and Order_Item (detail). An order can have multiple items, but
                                each item belongs to exactly one order.</li>
                            <li>Implementation: The detail entity typically includes a foreign key referencing the
                                master entity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Associative Entity Pattern</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used to represent a many-to-many relationship with additional attributes.</li>
                            <li>Example: Student and Course have a many-to-many relationship, with Enrollment as an
                                associative entity that includes attributes like semester and grade.</li>
                            <li>Implementation: The associative entity typically has a composite primary key consisting
                                of the primary keys of the two related entities.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Subtype/Supertype Pattern</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used to represent inheritance or specialization/generalization relationships.</li>
                            <li>Example: Person (supertype) with subtypes Employee and Customer. Each employee and
                                customer is also a person and inherits person attributes.</li>
                            <li>Implementation: Can be implemented in various ways, including single table inheritance,
                                table per class, or table per concrete class.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Recursive Relationship Pattern</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A relationship between entities of the same type.</li>
                            <li>Example: Employee "manages" Employee. One employee can manage multiple employees, but
                                each employee has at most one manager.</li>
                            <li>Implementation: Typically implemented using a self-referencing foreign key.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Weak Entity Pattern</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used when an entity's existence depends on another entity.</li>
                            <li>Example: Employee and Dependent. A dependent cannot exist without an associated
                                employee.</li>
                            <li>Implementation: The weak entity's primary key includes the primary key of the owner
                                entity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Common Mistakes in ER Modeling</h3>

                        <p>Even experienced designers can make mistakes when creating ER models. Being aware of common
                            pitfalls can help avoid them:</p>

                        <p><strong>Confusing Entities and Attributes</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mistake: Modeling something as an attribute when it should be an entity, or vice versa.
                            </li>
                            <li>Example: Modeling "address" as a simple attribute of Customer when it should be a
                                separate entity with its own attributes (street, city, state, zip).</li>
                            <li>Solution: Consider whether the item has its own properties or if multiple instances of
                                it need to be tracked. If so, it's likely an entity rather than an attribute.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Incorrect Cardinality</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mistake: Misidentifying the cardinality of a relationship.</li>
                            <li>Example: Modeling the relationship between Student and Course as one-to-many when it
                                should be many-to-many.</li>
                            <li>Solution: Carefully analyze the real-world relationship and consider multiple scenarios
                                to determine the correct cardinality.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Missing or Redundant Relationships</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mistake: Omitting necessary relationships or including redundant ones.</li>
                            <li>Example: Creating direct relationships A→B, B→C, and A→C when the A→C relationship is
                                redundant and can be derived from the other two.</li>
                            <li>Solution: Ensure that all required relationships are included, but avoid creating
                                relationships that can be derived from others.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Inappropriate Use of Weak Entities</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mistake: Modeling an entity as weak when it should be strong, or vice versa.</li>
                            <li>Example: Modeling Department as a weak entity of Company when it should be a strong
                                entity with its own primary key.</li>
                            <li>Solution: Only use weak entities when an entity's existence truly depends on another
                                entity and it cannot be uniquely identified without its owner.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Overcomplicating the Model</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mistake: Creating an unnecessarily complex model with too many entities and
                                relationships.</li>
                            <li>Example: Creating separate entities for every minor concept in the system.</li>
                            <li>Solution: Strive for simplicity while ensuring the model accurately represents the
                                requirements. Focus on the essential entities and relationships.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Ignoring Business Rules</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mistake: Failing to incorporate important business rules and constraints into the model.
                            </li>
                            <li>Example: Not capturing the rule that an employee can work in only one department at a
                                time.</li>
                            <li>Solution: Carefully analyze the requirements to identify all relevant business rules and
                                ensure they are reflected in the model through appropriate cardinality and participation
                                constraints.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Each department offers multiple courses. A course has a unique code, title, description,

                            <li>Students are enrolled in the university. Each student has an ID, name, date of birth,

                            <li>The chairperson relationship between Department and Professor is a 1:1 relationship, but
                                it's also a subset of the "employs" relationship (a chairperson must be a professor in
                                the department).</li>
                            <li>The Section entity represents specific offerings of a course in a particular semester,
                                allowing the same course to be offered multiple times with different professors,
                                schedules, and classrooms.</li>
                            <li>The Enrollment associative entity captures the many-to-many relationship between Student
                                and Section, with grade as an attribute of the relationship.</li>
                            <li>The model includes both structural relationships (e.g., Department "offers" Course) and
                                participatory relationships (e.g., Professor "teaches" Section).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This case study demonstrates how ER modeling can be used to design a database that accurately
                            represents a complex real-world system with multiple interrelated entities and
                            relationships.</p>

                    <h2>What Have We Learned in This Lesson?</h2>

                    <p>In this lesson, we have explored Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling, a fundamental technique for
                        conceptual database design. We have covered:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Database Design Process</strong>: We learned that database design typically follows
                            a structured approach consisting of requirements collection, conceptual design (using ER
                            modeling), logical design, and physical design.</li>

                        <li><strong>ER Model Concepts</strong>: We explored the key components of the ER model,
                            including entities, attributes, keys, relationships, cardinality and participation
                            constraints, and weak entities.</li>

                        <li><strong>ER Diagram Notation</strong>: We examined different notations for representing ER
                            models graphically, including Chen notation, Crow's Foot notation, and UML class diagram
                            notation.</li>

                        <li><strong>Practical ER Modeling</strong>: We learned practical techniques for creating ER
                            models, including how to identify entities, attributes, and relationships from requirements,
                            common design patterns, common mistakes to avoid, and a case study demonstrating the
                            application of ER modeling to a university database.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>ER modeling is a crucial skill for database designers and developers. It provides a way to
                        visualize and communicate the structure of a database before implementation, helping to ensure
                        that the database accurately represents the real-world system it's modeling. The ER model serves
                        as a blueprint for the subsequent logical and physical design phases, guiding the creation of
                        tables, columns, keys, and constraints in the actual database.</p>

                    <p>In the next lesson, we will explore how to translate ER models into relational database schemas,
                        a process known as ER-to-Relational mapping. This will bridge the gap between conceptual design
                        and logical design, bringing us one step closer to implementing our database.</p>

                    <h3 id="practice-exercises">Practice Exercises</h3>

                    <p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>: Identify the entities, attributes, and relationships in the
                        following scenario:</p>
                    <p>"A library maintains a collection of books. Each book has a unique ISBN, title, publication year,
                        and publisher. Books are written by one or more authors, and each author can write multiple
                        books. Authors have a unique ID, name, and nationality. The library has multiple branches, each
                        with a unique ID, name, address, and phone number. Each book copy has a unique copy number and
                        is held at a specific branch. Library members can borrow book copies. Each member has a unique
                        ID, name, address, and phone number. When a member borrows a book copy, the borrow date and due
                        date are recorded."</p>

                    <p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: Draw an ER diagram (using Chen notation) for a simple banking system
                        with the following requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The bank has multiple branches, each with a unique branch code, name, and address.</li>
                        <li>Customers have a unique customer ID, name, address, and phone number.</li>
                        <li>Accounts have a unique account number, type (checking, savings, etc.), balance, and date
                            opened.</li>
                        <li>Each account is owned by one or more customers, and each customer can own multiple accounts.
                        </li>
                        <li>Each account is maintained at exactly one branch, but a branch can maintain multiple
                            accounts.</li>
                        <li>Transactions are performed on accounts. Each transaction has a unique transaction ID, date,
                            amount, and type (deposit, withdrawal, transfer).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>: Convert the following ER diagram (described textually) to Crow's
                        Foot notation:</p>
                    <p>"The ER diagram shows three entities: Department, Employee, and Project. Department has
                        attributes dept_id (primary key), name, and location. Employee has attributes emp_id (primary
                        key), name, salary, and hire_date. Project has attributes project_id (primary key), name,
                        start_date, and end_date. There is a one-to-many relationship 'Works_In' between Department and
                        Employee (an employee works in exactly one department, and a department can have many
                        employees). There is a many-to-many relationship 'Assigned_To' between Employee and Project (an
                        employee can be assigned to multiple projects, and a project can have multiple employees
                        assigned to it). The 'Assigned_To' relationship has an attribute hours_worked."</p>

                    <p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>: Identify and correct the mistakes in the following ER model
                        description:</p>
                    <p>"A university database has entities Student, Course, and Grade. Student has attributes
                        student_id, name, and major. Course has attributes course_code, title, and credits. Grade has
                        attributes letter_grade and numeric_grade. There is a one-to-one relationship 'Enrolls_In'
                        between Student and Course. There is a one-to-many relationship between Student and Grade, and a
                        one-to-many relationship between Course and Grade."</p>

                    <p><strong>Exercise 5</strong>: Design an ER model for an online shopping system with the following
                        requirements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customers can register on the website by providing their name, email, password, shipping
                            address, and payment information.</li>
                        <li>The system sells products from various categories. Each product has a unique ID, name,
                            description, price, and inventory quantity.</li>
                        <li>Customers can place orders for multiple products. Each order has a unique order number,
                            order date, shipping address, payment method, and status.</li>
                        <li>For each product in an order, the quantity and price at the time of purchase are recorded.
                        </li>
                        <li>Customers can write reviews for products they have purchased. Each review includes a rating
                            (1-5 stars), a comment, and a date.</li>
                        <li>The system also tracks shipments. Each shipment has a tracking number, carrier, shipping
                            date, and estimated delivery date.</li>
                    </ul>
