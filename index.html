                <h2>Course Overview</h2>
                <p>Welcome to <strong>CP363 - Database I</strong>. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to database systems, with a strong emphasis on relational database concepts, design, and implementation. You will explore key topics including data models, query languages (with a focus on SQL), database design using Entity-Relationship modeling, and relational database theory.</p>

                <p>Additionally, the course covers critical aspects of <strong>database management systems,</strong> including <strong>data integrity, security,</strong>  and <strong>mechanisms for concurrency control and recovery.</strong></p>

                <p>Structured in a thematic and progressive manner, each module integrates theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice using industry-standard tools. This practical approach ensures you build both the conceptual foundation and applied skills needed for real-world database management and development roles.</p>
